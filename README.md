# my_setup

This is the script is used to set up my development environment.

## Prerequisites
* MacOS Sequoia and higher (I've only tested it on Sequoia)
* Mac OS X command line tools (`xcode-select --install`)
* Ruby 2.6.0 or higher (MacOS Sequoia already has it)
* *Optional* [XQuartz](https://xquartz.macosforge.org/) - for X11

## Getting Started

Simply checkout the repo and run the provision script. The script is pretty minimal and reads like a shell script.
The script is also idempotent so you don't have to worry about running it multiple times.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ktham/my_setup.git ~/my_setup
cd my_setup
./provision
```

## Customizations
### zsh
Add your own files to `~/.zshrc.d` and it will automatically be loaded.
